Of course. Here is the updated `README.md` for the project, now called **`reaganlog`**.

# `reaganlog`

`reaganlog` is a terminal-based system log viewer. It provides a clean, real-time interface for monitoring system logs and includes powerful features like filtering, searching, and saving logs.

-----

## Features ‚ú®

  * **Real-time Log Streaming**: View `journalctl` logs as they happen, with updates every few seconds.
  * **Color-Coded Output**: Quickly spot important messages with different colors for **errors**, **warnings**, and **standard information**.
  * **Interactive Filtering**: Filter logs by type (errors, warnings) or by specific services like `sshd` and `cron`.
  * **Search Functionality**: Use the built-in search bar to quickly find specific messages.
  * **Highlight and Copy**: Highlight important log lines for later review and copy them directly to your clipboard.
  * **System Health Report**: Generate a quick summary report to see the total number of errors and warnings and the message count for tracked services.
  * **Save Logs**: Save all logs or just your highlighted logs to a file.
